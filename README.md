# cpp_triangle_area_functions
The Triangle Area Functions Program (C++) uses a loop to ask the user 1 of 2 methods to calculate the area of a triangle. The 1st method calculates the area with the base &amp; height values, while the 2nd calculates the area with all 3 sides.

Calculated values are printed to the console as output, and the program loops until the user chooses to exit.
